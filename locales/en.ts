The intention is to offer a sense of what being in the SPX community *feels* like, while also capturing SPX's impressive depth and breadth (the mission, culture, lore, scope, opportunity, and energy) without needing to experience it first-hand from within the community. Which is of course the best way to fully understand SPX, but that takes time and may come later. With leading analysts saying SPX6900 could be the fastest asset to reach $1T market cap, understanding SPX6900 could be one of the best decisions you ever make. And there’s no better place to learn about it than CogMi.",
